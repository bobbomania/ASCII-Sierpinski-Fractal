# ASCII-Sierpinski-fractal
This code, written in Python, aims at recreating the famous triangular fractal first discovered by Waclaw Sierpinski. This particular code does so via ASCII and by outputting the result in the console. 

The program has to be called with the function sierpinski(n) , where n is the power of 2 that rappresents the length of the side of the fractal.
